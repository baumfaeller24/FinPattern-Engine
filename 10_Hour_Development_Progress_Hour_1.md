## ðŸŽ¯ **Hour 1: Live System Scalping Tests**

### âœ… **System Status Confirmed:**
- **Live System:** Fully operational and accessible at https://urfpj9ftymspf3o6henh7p.streamlit.app/
- **All 5 Core Modules:** Verified as complete and ready for scalping development
- **DataIngest:** Confirmed support for 100/1000-tick bars and full OHLC data
- **Labeling:** First-Hit-Logic and EWMA volatility ready for use
- **Exporter:** Pine Script and NautilusTrader export functionality confirmed

### ðŸš€ **Initial Scalping Strategy Development:**

#### **1. Breakout Strategy (100-Tick Bars):**
- **Concept:** Identify rapid price movements that break out of a recent range
- **Signal Generation:**
  - **Entry:** When price closes above the high of the last 50 bars (for long) or below the low of the last 50 bars (for short)
  - **Exit:** Triple-barrier method (profit-take, stop-loss, time-out)
- **Implementation:**
  - Began creating a new Python script `scalping_strategy_breakout.py`
  - Defined the core logic for signal generation

#### **2. Mean-Reversion Strategy (1000-Tick Bars):**
- **Concept:** Capitalize on price returning to its recent average
- **Signal Generation:**
  - **Entry:** When price deviates significantly from a moving average (e.g., 2 standard deviations)
  - **Exit:** When price returns to the moving average or hits a profit target
- **Implementation:**
  - Outlined the structure for `scalping_strategy_mean_reversion.py`
  - Identified necessary technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, RSI)

### ðŸ“Š **Progress Summary:**

- **Live System:** Fully validated and ready for scalping development
- **Breakout Strategy:** Initial implementation started
- **Mean-Reversion Strategy:** Conceptual framework defined
- **Data Focus:** 100-tick bars for breakout, 1000-tick bars for mean-reversion

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps (Hours 2-3):**
- Complete the implementation of the breakout and mean-reversion strategies
- Develop a testing framework for these strategies
- Generate initial backtesting results with demo data
- Create Pine Script exports for visualization in TradingView
