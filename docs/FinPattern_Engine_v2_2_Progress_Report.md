# FinPattern-Engine v2.2 Progress Report

**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the significant progress made in the FinPattern-Engine v2.2 development cycle. Following the hybrid roadmap proposed by ChatGPT and refined by our team, we have successfully implemented several key enhancements that dramatically improve the scientific rigor and practical utility of the system. This document details the completion of Modules 1, 2, and 4 enhancements.

## 2. Module 1 (DataIngest) v2.2: Enhanced Tick-Slice-Export

The DataIngest module has been upgraded to version 2.2, incorporating the critical **Tick-Slice-Export** functionality. This feature is foundational for the First-Hit-Logic implemented in the Labeling module.

### Key Enhancements:

- **Event-Based Tick Storage:** Instead of a single large file, tick data is now stored in individual, compressed Parquet files for each bar or event (e.g., `ticks_event_000001.parquet`).
- **Precision Timing:** Each tick slice now includes `time_from_bar_start_ns` metadata, allowing for nanosecond-level precision in analyzing intra-bar price movements.
- **Optimized Storage:** All Parquet files are now written with ZSTD compression and optimized row-group sizes, significantly reducing storage footprint and improving read performance.
- **Enhanced Manifest:** The output manifest now includes detailed information about `pip_size`, `bar_rules_id`, `export_slices` status, and performance metrics.

These improvements ensure that our labeling process is based on the most granular data available, eliminating look-ahead bias and providing a solid foundation for scientific backtesting.

## 3. Module 2 (Labeling) v2.2: First-Hit-Logic and Dynamic Volatility

The Labeling module has been upgraded to version 2.2, leveraging the new tick-slice data to implement a scientifically robust **First-Hit-Logic**.

### Key Enhancements:

- **Tick-Level First-Hit Detection:** The module now uses the individual tick slices to determine the precise moment a take-profit or stop-loss level is hit, correctly resolving simultaneous hits within a single bar.
- **Dynamic Volatility Scaling:** Take-profit and stop-loss levels are no longer static. They are now dynamically scaled based on the **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)** of volatility calculated for each specific event. This makes the strategy more adaptive to changing market conditions.
- **Dual Timeout System:** The triple-barrier method now supports timeouts defined in both **number of bars** and **seconds**, providing greater flexibility in strategy definition.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** The labeling summary now includes detailed statistics on win rates, average returns, and the number of events enhanced with tick-slice data.

## 4. Module 4 (Splitter) v1.0: Walk-Forward Validation

A new **Splitter** module (v1.0) has been implemented to provide robust, scientifically sound data splitting for backtesting. This is a critical component for preventing overfitting and ensuring that our strategies are truly predictive.

### Key Features:

- **Walk-Forward Validation:** The primary feature is a configurable Walk-Forward splitter that creates a series of rolling time windows for training and testing, simulating how a strategy would perform in a live environment.
- **Versatile Splitting Methods:** In addition to Walk-Forward, the module supports:
    - Standard time-based splits (e.g., 70/15/15).
    - Session-aware splits that respect specific trading hours.
    - Rolling window splits based on a fixed number of samples.
- **Automated Leakage Audit:** A crucial feature that automatically inspects each split for data leakage (e.g., overlapping train/test periods, duplicate data), ensuring the integrity of our backtests.

## 5. Next Steps: Module 5 (Exporter)

With the core engine enhancements now complete and validated, the next logical step is to implement **Module 5: The Exporter**. This module will allow us to translate the signals and strategies generated by the FinPattern-Engine into formats usable by popular trading platforms.

### Planned Features:

- **TradingView Pine Script Export:** Generate Pine Script v5 code for easy visualization and validation of our signals on TradingView charts.
- **NautilusTrader Export:** Create Python-based strategy files compatible with the NautilusTrader backtesting and live trading framework.
- **GUI Integration:** Add simple export buttons to the Streamlit GUI to make this functionality easily accessible.

This will bridge the gap between research and practical application, allowing for the immediate use of our findings.
